Bleep bloop I am a bot.

I am helping the folks of [mite-standard](https://github.com/mite-standard) automate the boring stuff.

I am supervised by [mmzdouc](https://github.com/mmzdouc) - ping him if there is anything to discuss.

Check out our awesome community-driven data curation project [MITE](https://mite.bioinformatics.nl)!
